### 🌏 Featured: AI Orbital Data Centers Interactive Poster

**A collaborative ISU project exploring sustainable computing in space**

I was part of the team that created an interactive, immersive poster on **AI-orchestrated orbital data centers**—a groundbreaking concept for decoupling compute growth from terrestrial environmental constraints.

#### Key Highlights:
- **10x Carbon Reduction** via solar-powered space infrastructure
- **Zero Water Usage** through passive radiative cooling in the vacuum of space
- **25ms LEO Latency** for near-real-time edge analytics
- **AI Integration** for autonomous routing, distributed learning, and fault detection
- **Sustainability Focus** balancing environmental and societal impacts
